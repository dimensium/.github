This is [Dimensium], the software organisation for a series of projects. We have our [coding standards], our [intent-expression library], and a lot of repositories.

## Our Projects

- **Project Dimensium**
  - [dimensium-base], the base library to implement basic funcitonalities, including file writing, etc.
  - [dimensium-core], the executable to supply world state emulaiton and implements all the calculations.

    - dimensium-frontend-vulkan, the Vulkan implementation of Freecraft Frontend Standard.
    - dimensium-frontend-gl, also, but OpenGL.
